# React Particle Resume

## Description
This project is cloned from [https://github.com/nordicgiant2/react-nice-resume](https://github.com/nordicgiant2/react-nice-resume). I just customized some things for my needs.

This project forks from [https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template), I made some modifications and adjustments, thanks to the [author](https://github.com/tbakerx) and [nordicgiant2](https://github.com/nordicgiant2) for their work.

### DEMO is [here](https://nordicgiant2.github.io/react-nice-resume-page/index.html)

The project uses the React Particle background component and you can learn more about that here:

*Eventually I'd like to templatize this repo but that is later down the line.*

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project
2. Run the project
```shell
npm i
npm start
```
> If `npm start` throws you an error it may be due to outdated packages. I was able to resolve the issue following the instructions in [this](https://reactgo.com/update-npm-packages-latest/) link.
3. Build
```shell
npm run build
```
